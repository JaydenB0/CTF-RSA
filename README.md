### Planned Features

- Calculate missing variables
- Perform common attacks

### Purpose
The purpose of this framework is to make solving cryptography problems involving RSA as easy and **intuitive** as possible.

### Build
To compile this framework, run `make`

### Running
To run this framework, just execute the binary with the given integers as flags like:

```
./ctfrsa -p <INT> -q <INT>
./ctfrsa -h
./ctfrsa -c <INT< -d <INT> -n <INT>
```

If you've found this framework useful, please star and pass the word on!
