# CTF-RSA (WIP)
CTF Framework for RSA Cryptography

### Planned Features

- Calculate missing variables
- Perform common attacks

### Purpose
The purpose of this framework is to make solving cryptography problems involving RSA as easy and **intuitive** as possible.

### Build
To compile this framework, run `build`

### Running
To run this framework, just execute the binary with the given integers as flags like:


`./ctfrsa -p <INT> -q <INT>`


This command would calculate n and totient for you.
